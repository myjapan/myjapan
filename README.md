- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Linux, Ansible and Arduino projects    
     Started with ZX Spectrum, falled in love with Commodore Amiga, after struggling too many years with Windows, I switched to Linux   
     I like to scale out, and Ansible is a great tool to do it :)    
     Arduino: my neverending project is a Railroad Layout managed with Arduino
