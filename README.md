- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @myjapan
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Linux, Ansible and Arduino projects
     Linux: since I was a teenager (I started with ZX Spectrum but falled in love with Commodore Amiga) after struggling too many years with Win
     Ansible: since I like to scale out :)
     Arduino: my neverending project is a Railroad Layout managed with Arduino
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ansible
