- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Linux, Ansible and Arduino projects    
     Started with ZX Spectrum, falled in love with Commodore Amiga, after struggling too many years with Windows, I switched to Linux   
     Ansible: since I like to scale out :)    
     Arduino: my neverending project is a Railroad Layout managed with Arduino    
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ansible
